                    <h2>Common problems for dogs and their solution</h2>
                    <h3>• Chewing issues</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Dogs also show gnawing behavior to release their energy and relax their teeth.
                        This is a natural need! You can buy them suitable toys or offer them hard bones.
                        You can also leave special treat-filled toys for them to chew on when they are alone at home.
                    </div>

                    <h3>• Problem with the Toilet</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Toilet training requires patience! Get your dog accustomed to a certain routine by taking him after meals to that place.
                        When he goes to the toilet there, a lot of praise and good rewards await him. No dog learns in one day.
                    </div>

                    <h3>• Pulling Problem</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Walks with your dog should not be a drag! To prevent pulling, one can try using a light leash with reinforcement of good behavior to make him stop pulling via treats.
                        It will also come in handy to stop and distract him with commands in the middle of the walk.
                    </div>

                    <h3>• Barking Problem When Knocking at the Door</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Dogs that bark when the door rings normally do so for protection.
                        This you can control by teaching them to stay quiet after the person who is coming is introduced. Remember to reward them after they stay quiet.
                    </div>

                    <h3>• Guidelines for Food and Water Provisioning</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Be sure to feed your dog the appropriate amount of food based on their age, size, and activity level. 
                        Always keep a clean, full bowl of water available! Opt for high-quality food recommended by your veterinarian.
                    </div>

                    <h3>•  Coat Health Tips</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Regular brushing helps minimize shedding and keeps your dog's coat healthy.
                        Weekly baths using moisturizing dog shampoos are beneficial. You might also consider Omega-3 supplements for better coat health.
                    </div>

                    <h3>• Veterinary Check-Up Recommendations</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Don’t neglect regular medical check-ups for your dog.
                        Follow the annual vaccination schedule and consult your vet for advice on dental health.
                        Even if your dog seems fine, a yearly general check-up is advisable.
                    </div>

                    <h3>• Time Management Tips for Quality Interaction</h3>
                    <div class="help-sectiontext">
                        Spending quality time with your dog ensures their happiness and health.
                        Dedicate at least 30 minutes daily for walks and playtime. 
                        You can also introduce small brain games for your dog to play at home.
                    </div>

                <h2>Common problems for cats and their solution</h2>
                <h3>• Litter Training</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Cats instinctively like using litter boxes. To make their experience pleasant, keep the litter box clean and place it in a quiet, cozy spot. 
                    If you’re introducing a new litter box, be patient—it might take them a little time to get used to it.
                </div>

                <h3>• Food and Water Bowl Placement</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Your cat’s food and water bowls should be in a quiet, easily accessible, and clean area. 
                    Refresh their water frequently to keep it fresh. 
                    Also, try to keep their food and water bowls in separate locations for their comfort.
                </div>

                <h3>• Regular Vet Visits</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Don’t skip your cat’s yearly health check-ups and vaccinations. 
                    Regular treatments for internal and external parasites are a must. 
                    If you notice any health concerns, don’t hesitate to consult your veterinarian.
                </div>

                <h3>• Ear Cleaning Tips</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Regular ear checks are essential since dirty ears can lead to infections. 
                    Ask your vet for a safe ear-cleaning solution and gently clean your cat’s ears as needed.
                </div>

                <h3>• Dealing with Chin Acne</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Cats can develop chin acne, often caused by unhygienic food bowls. 
                    Switch to ceramic or stainless steel bowls and clean them regularly to prevent this problem.
                </div>

                <h3>• Grooming for a Healthy Coat</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Brushing your cat several times a week helps reduce shedding and prevents hairballs. 
                    Long-haired cats might benefit from special grooming tools. 
                    Feeding high-quality cat food and adding Omega-3 supplements can also improve their coat’s health.
                </div>

                <h3>• Spending Quality Time Together</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Cats are independent but still crave love and interaction. 
                    Spend at least 15–20 minutes each day playing with your cat to keep them happy and active. 
                    You can also enhance their environment by adding climbing spaces for fun and exercise.
                </div>

                <h3>• Keeping Nails Healthy</h3>
                <div class="help-sectiontext">
                    Check your cat’s nails regularly and trim them when needed using a proper clipper. 
                    If your cat enjoys scratching, provide a sturdy scratching post to save your furniture and keep their claws healthy.
